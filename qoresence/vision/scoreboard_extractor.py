"""Local scoreboard OCR + parsing for NCAA football frames.

Uses EasyOCR on a bottom-center crop and extracts score, quarter, clock,
down/distance, and play-clock from the HUD. No cloud VLM calls.

Score updates are **stabilized** (temporal consensus + plausible deltas) so a
single misread like 17-2 cannot wipe a real 17-17.
